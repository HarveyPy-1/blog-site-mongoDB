- You can create dynamic URLs by adding a colon before them ("/posts/:whatevernameyouwant)

- To get the value of the variable username, you can use (req.params.thenameyouchoseabove)

- If you use just (req.params), it'll give you all the values of all the variables in an array. Yes, you can have more than one.  ("/posts/:1stvariable/and/:2ndvariable)

- It helps working with arrays, objects, numbers, easy.

- I think it's just like jQuery which takes the hassle out of javascript normal way of writing plenty code to achieve a small thing.

- Makes life easy. Example, just say (_.capitalize) to capitalise the first word of a document. Normal javascript will require you to do charAt(), find the first letter, turn it to upperCase (charAt(0).upperCase), then concatenate it with the rest of the words... Pheeew!
